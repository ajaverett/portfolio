# Central Tendency

The mean and the median are two different ways of describing the "middle" of a group of numbers.

**Mean (Average)**

The mean (also known as average) is found by adding up all of the numbers in the group and then dividing that number by the total number of numbers in the group. For example, if a group of kids has the following test scores: 82, 85, 90, 91, and 92, the mean (or average) score would be calculated like this:

```{r}
# The code below is just printing out the class average

class_average <- (82 + 85 + 90 + 91 + 92) / 5

print(class_average)
```

*The class mean or class average is 88*

**Median**

The median is the number that is in the middle of the group when the numbers are listed in order from least to greatest. In the same group of scores above, the numbers would be listed like this when they are in order: 82, 85, 90, 91, and 92. The number in the middle is 90.

*The class mean is 90*

Basically, the mean is found by adding up all of the numbers and dividing by the total number of numbers, while the median is the number in the middle when the numbers are listed in order. Both the mean and the median can be used to describe the "middle" of a group of numbers, but they can sometimes give different results.

# Normal Distributions

For people that go to the gym, you may see wear and tear on some of the equipment. On the image below, a curve shape appears with the deterioration of the metal finish. The center of this curve represents the average weightlifting ability of the population that uses it. There would be fewer people who would lift significantly more or less weight than the average. This pattern is called a **normal distribution.**

If we were to graph height, most people tend to be around the average since there are natural limits to how tall or short people can be.

# Standard Deviation

"A **standard deviation** is a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean. Low standard deviation means data are clustered around the mean, and high standard deviation indicates data are more spread out. A standard deviation close to zero indicates that data points are close to the mean, whereas a high or low standard deviation indicates data points are respectively above or below the mean." \[[1](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/stats_tutorial/section2/mod8_sd.html#_ftnref1)\]

-   $\mu$ refers to the mean or average

-   $\sigma$ refers to a standard deviation

The standard deviation, as explained above, measures the spread of the data. To see this with an example, take two cities, Kansas City, MO, and San Diego, CA. In 2019, both of these cities probably had an average temperature in the 60's. The green line in the picture above represents the average temperature.

though the average temperatures were comparable, the spread is much bigger for one of these cities. \[[2](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Missouri/Places/kansas-city-temperatures-by-month-average.php)\]\[[3](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/California/Places/san-diego-temperatures-by-month-average.php)\]

-   Kansas City, MO- low/high: 22째F-91째F

-   San Diego, CA- low/high: 50째F-77째F

We can expect the standard deviation for temperature to be far greater in Kansas City than San Diego.
